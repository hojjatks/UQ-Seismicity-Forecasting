# Uncertainty Quantification Method For Induced Seismicity forecasting
* This code is generated as supplementary material for the following paper:

Induced Seismicity Forecasting with Uncertainty Quantification: Application to the Groningen Gas Field
 
* 

This code quantifies the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and combines them to give a range for the number of earthquakes in each time bin for a desired confidence level. These codes are for Examples 2 and 3 Introduced in Appendix 3 of the paper.
